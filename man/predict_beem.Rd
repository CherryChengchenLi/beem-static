\usage{
predict_beem(dat.new, beem, dev, ncpu = 4, pert.new = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat.new}{OTU count/relative abundance matrix (each OTU in one row)}

\item{beem}{output of the EM algorithm}

\item{dev}{deviation of the error (for one sample) from the model to be excluded}

\item{ncpu}{number of CPUs (default: 4)}

\item{pert.new}{external perturbation presence matrix (each perturbation in one row, each sample in one column) (Default: NULL)}
}
