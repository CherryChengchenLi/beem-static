# BEEM-static
 
 - Authors: Chenhao Li, Niranjan Nagarajan
 
## Description

<img src="logo.png" height="200" align="right" />

BEEM-static is an R package for learning **directed microbial interactions** from cross-sectional microbiome profiling data based on the generalized Lotka-Volterra model (gLVM). Extending the core idea of the original BEEM algorithm for longitudinal data ([Reference](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-019-0729-z), [Source code](https://github.com/CSB5/BEEM)), BEEM-static directly works with **relative abundances** to jointly estimate **total biomass** and **gLVM parameters**, thus eliminating the need for experimentally quantifying absolute abundances. BEEM-static identifies microbiomes that are not at equilibrium states and automatically excludes such samples from the analysis. The package also provides the user with a collection of utility functions for visualizing and diagnosing the fitted model.

**Note**: This package is under active development. Please record the commit ID for reproducibility.

## Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('lch14forever/BEEM-static')
```

## Example usage

### Dataset

The demo dataset is a simulated community of 20 species and 500 samples. All of the samples are at the equilibrium states (generated by numerically integrating the gLVM until convergence) and each sample contains 70% of all the species randomly (each species has a 70% habitat preference). 

```{r}
library(beemStatic)
data("beemDemo")
attach(beemDemo)

```

### Analysis with BEEM-static

BEEM-static is run by calling the `func.EM` function.

```{r, message=FALSE}
res <- func.EM(dat.w.noise, ncpu=4, scaling=median(biomass.true), max.iter=200, epsilon = 1e-4)
```

#### Visualizing inferred interaction network

We provide a function `showInteraction` to plot the interaction network inferred by BEEM-static (based on the [ggraph](https://github.com/thomasp85/ggraph) package).

```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=8}
showInteraction(res, dat.w.noise)
```

#### Estimating biomass

BEEM-static also estimates the biomass for each sample (retrieved by the `beem2biomass` function). Here we can compare the estimated biomass with the true biomass on this simulated dataset.

```{r}
plot(beem2biomass(res), biomass.true, xlab='BEEM biomass estimation', ylab='True biomass')
```

#### Investigating model fit

We provide a function `diagnoseFit` to plot the [coefficient of determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination) (R<sup>2</sup>) for each species. A high R<sup>2</sup> (close to 1) value indicates that the variation in the data is well explained by the model.

```{r}
diagnoseFit(res, dat.w.noise, annotate = FALSE)
```

### Comparing BEEM-static with correlation based methods

We now run two popular methods for inferring microbial interactions on our simulated data. Both methods try to infer a correlation matrix as a proxy for the interaction matrix.

1. Using an naive Spearman's correlation method

```{r}
spearman <- cor(t(dat.w.noise), method='spearman')
```

2. Using [SPIEC-EASI](https://github.com/zdk123/SpiecEasi)
```{r}
## devtools::install_github("zdk123/SpiecEasi")
library(SpiecEasi)
se <- spiec.easi(t(dat.w.noise), method='mb')
se.stab <- as.matrix(getOptMerge(se))
```

3. Using BEEM-static

```{r}
est <- beem2param(res)
```

We implement a function `auc.b` for ploting the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with computed area under the curve (AUC). We compare the ROC curves of the above three methods. We use `inference` function provided in the pacakge to estimate confidence values (t-statistics) that can be used to rank the predictions.

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=10}
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
auc.b(spearman, scaled.params$b.truth, is.association = TRUE, main='Spearman correlation', print.auc.cex=2)
auc.b(se.stab, scaled.params$b.truth, is.association = TRUE, main='SPIEC-EASI', print.auc.cex=2)
auc.b(inference(dat.w.noise, res), scaled.params$b.truth, main='BEEM-static', print.auc.cex=2)
```
